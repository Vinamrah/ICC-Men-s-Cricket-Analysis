# ICC-Men-s-Cricket-Analysis
ESPNcricinfo Records for ICC Men's ALL FORMATS

###### Data Collection : The data was gathered using web scraping techniques from the publicly available records on the ESPN Cricinfo website. This included accessing pages that contain detailed match information for all the three formats of the game played between 1990 and 2024. The web scraping process was performed using tools or libraries such as Python with BeautifulSoup. These tools allowed for automated extraction of structured data from the website. After the initial extraction, the data was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency and usability.

###### Through in-depth analysis, the data revealed significant insights.
###### Upon further scrutiny, I have assembled an all-time greatest cricket team based on my personal considerations and assistance from the data.
